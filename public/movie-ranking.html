 <h1>The Best Movies According to Lenk</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>The Godfather</h3>
 <p>I enjoyed the first two parts of The Godfather's saga but if i had to pick one, 
    that will be the first part. Before watching it, i heard people saying incredible things about it 
    and i was curious about why, so i give it a try and damn, it did not dissapoint. Pretty good movie, very good acting. 
    Just perfect.</p>
 <h3>Back to the Future Trilogy</h3>
 <p>I'm unable to pick one so i will pick the whole trilogy (I like seeing them as a whole movie). 
    Some things maybe have aged poorly, like the CGI, but despite that it's a very entertaining adventure. 
    This trilogy it's arguably one of the Sci-fi related things out there.</p>
 <h3>Rango</h3>
 <p>A very well animated western movie that wasn't appreciated in it's time. 
    A movie about of finding yourself on this world full of uncertainty. 
    Recommend to everyone even if your not a fan of westerns.</p>
